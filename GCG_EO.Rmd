##  About Earth Observation!

Earth Observation is an advanced course for students of the Master of Science ["Global Change Geography"](https://www.geographie.hu-berlin.de/en/studies/study-programs/master-degree-programs/master-of-science) of Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, other interested parties are cordially invited to join. In this course, we cover multiple aspects of optical remote sensing by working with multi-sprectral Landsat and Sentinel 2 imagery. The course is fully based on open source software, including R and QGIS.

As you followed the curriculum of the MSc program, you most likely joined the module "Quantitative Methods for Geographers", in which you learned using R for statistical problems. Here, we built on your existing knowledge. If you are not enrolled in the MSc program, feel free to look at the [course materials](https://github.com/corneliussenf/quantitative_methods). 

Alternatively, you may want to follow one of the numerous tutorials for R fundamentals (e.g., [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/online-learning/), [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r), [UMC Utrecht](http://www.r-tutorial.nl/)), or advanced tutorials for geodata processing (e.g., [Wageningen University](https://geoscripting-wur.github.io/), [University of Colorado](https://www.earthdatascience.org/)).

------

## Learning goals & course contents

The main goal of this course is to provide you with the necessary knowledge and tools for using optical remote sensing datasets and methods in the geo-scientific context. We want you to enhance your ability of problem-solving, empowering you to perform research independently. To that end, we cover aspects of data acquisition, spatial data handling in R and QGIS, basics of image pre-processing, higher-level processing such as pixel-based compositing and time-series binning. 

We use state of the art methods in image processing and time series analyses of optical satellite imagery. The course covers methods related to data quality, cloud masking, vegetation indices, multi-temporal image analyses, machine learning classification algorithms, 
area adjusted accuracy assessment, time series analyses, and image compositing. 

We use these methods for mapping of forest types, forest cover changes, agricultural dynamics in the Carpathian ecoregion (Poland), the  Southern Brazilian Amazon, and Crete in Greece.

## Course materials

### Readings

The first sessions of the course contain reading materials, such as are peer-reviewed papers and technical reports. You will find the reading materials for the next session at the end of each session. We highlight aspects to focus upon to streamline the reading process and facilitate the discussion. We are looking forward to lively discussions of the reading materials and critical questions from your end. 

### Data

All data used in the course is openly accessible. Mostly, we´ll be working with Landsat images, which you can access through the USGS Earth Explorer. We provide download links to the datasets for each session. It will be helpful if you organize your data in a course directory on your local machine (MSc students might want to use drive O:/Student_Data/).

### Exercises

The weekly exercises are defined in the respective session. Each session comprises several tasks that involve scipting in R. Course participants must submit their R script in [moodle](http://moodle.hu-berlin.de/) to pass the course. Please organize your scripts according to the following structure:

```

# Introducing R 

## Why use R?

R is a programming language and open source software environment for statistical computing and graphics. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. R was developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. The name R originates the first names of the two authors and refers to the programming language S. The project was conceived in 1992, with an initial version released in 1995 and a stable beta version in 2000.

programming entry point | easy to learn | great support | open source |  data wrangling |  visualization | works cross-platform  | popular in science & industry | job opportunities

![Fig.1: A rising tide for R (Tipman 2015; doi: 10.1038/517109a)](fig/fig00.png)

The CRAN package repository currently features 13,203 packages serving a variety of purposes, e.g. 

- data manipulation: ```tidyr```, ```dplyr```, ```caret```
- visualization: ```ggplot2```, ```ggmap```
- spatial data: ```raster```, ```rgdal```, ```sp```, ```Rstoolbox```


------

## The ```raster``` package

It´s great, as it facilitates raster data handling. It allows us to access file characteristics before loading data into memory, facilitates handling of coordinate reference systems and spatial extents. We can use it to perform raster algebra, to combine raster and vector datasets (e.g. ESRI shapefiles), or to convert raster files into matrices, which are compatible with the base functions to access image statistics, develop models, slice data dimensions etc.

There are a couple of things that the raster package does not provide. Advanced visualization of spatial datasets and manual operations, such collecting training or validation data, are preferably done in a GIS environment (e.g. QGIS). Furthermore, processing large data volumes in R can be quite time-consuming.

``` 
## Install the raster and rgdal packages
install.package('raster')
install.package('rgdal')

## Load the package
library(raster)
``` 

------


## Coding style

A short summary of [Hadley´s style guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html):

- Regularly save your progress. 
- Script names should be meaningful and end in '.R'

- Comment (#) your code & separate it into readable chunks.
- Try to limit your code to 80 characters per line.

- Variable and function names should be lowercase. 
- Variable names should be nouns and function names verbs.
- Use underscores to separate words within a name. 

- Place spaces around operators (=, +, -, <-, etc.) and after commas.
- Use <-, not =, for assignment. 

An example: 

```{r style, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 3, fig.align = "center"}

## Creating random data and a correlated response 
## Philippe Rufin, 2019

## Load all required packages
library(ggplot2)

# Create random data
x <- runif(50, 0, 2)

# Build function to simulate response
create_response <- function(x){x + rnorm(50, 0, 0.2)}

# Apply function to random data
y <- create_response(x)

# Make a dataframe
data <- data.frame('x'=x, 'y'=y)

# Plot the simulated dataset
ggplot(data, aes(x=x, y=y)) +
  geom_point()

# Investigate correlation in the data
cor(data$x, data$y)

``` 

------

## Help!
If you get stuck, there are plenty of things you can do: 

- seek the function´s help page (e.g. by highlighting the function and hitting F1)
- ask your colleagues using the moodle forum!
- search your problem or error message
- check forums (e.g. [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) 
- package vignette / documentation

# Session 01: Raster handling in R

## Learning goals

In this session, you will

- download multi-spectral satellite data.
- read & write rastser data.
- crop the spatial extent of rasters.
- extract cell values.
- plot a spectral profile. 

------

## Data acquisition

Let´s download a Landsat image. Visit the [USGS Earth Explorer](http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) and navigate to Wisła, Poland	(lat,lon: 49.6473,18.8677), using the Adress/Place field. Switch to the 'Data Sets' tab and select Landsat -> Landsat Collection 1 Level-1. Tick the 'Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS C1 Level 1' box and click on 'Results >>'. 

You´ll get several hundreds of results, so let´s narrow down the search. Switch to the 'Additional Criteria' tab. Let´s choose a scene cloud cover of 'Less than 40%', the 'Tier 1' category and narrow the date range to the year 2015.

Find the following images and display them in the Earth Explorer interface:

- LC08_L1TP_188026_20150423_20170409_01_T1
- LC08_L1TP_189025_20150820_20170406_01_T1
- LC08_L1TP_188026_20151101_20170402_01_T1

For downloading the images, you will need an EarthExplorer account. Register and download the .zip files. Unpack them to a designated folder for this session. If you prefer not to register, you can download the files from our repository. 

```
## Define a path you want to store this session´s data in
path <- 'O:/Student_Data/your_name/EO/S01/'

## Create data directory in your working directory
dir.create(paste0(path,'data'), showWarnings = TRUE)

## Download the files for this session
if (!file.exists('data/rs/samples.rds')) {
  download.file('https://biogeo.ucdavis.edu/data/rspatial/rsdata.zip', dest = 'data/rsdata.zip')
  unzip('data/rsdata.zip', exdir='data')
}
```

------

### Reading data 

X) Visit the folder containing the unpacked Landsat image. As you can see, the Landsat images we provided come as single-band files and should be stacked for further analyses. For stacking, all input files must have a matching extent and the identical projection. Today, you will make use of R´s raster package classes and functions which are well described in the package documentation. Get acquainted with the following classes / functions and what they are useful for:

```raster()```, ```stack()``` ,```extent()```, ```crop()```,  ```extract()```, ```CRS()```, ```projectRaster()```, ```plotRGB()```, ```writeRaster()```

X) Create stacks for each of the Landsat 8 images. Please include only the following bands: blue, green, red, near infrared, shortwave infrared 1, shortwave infrared 2 (in this order). Check the list of [Landsat spectral bands](https://landsat.usgs.gov/what-are-band-designations-landsat-satellites/) for a recap. 

![Band designations for Landsat satellites](fig/ls_bands.jpg)

Try to create the stacks with a minimum amount of code as possible! Consider using helper functions such as ```paste0()```, ```dir()``` or ```list.files()```.

------

### Manipulating data

X) Check the extent of the images. You will notice that they vary from each other. Find an efficient way to identify the common extent (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax in projected coordinates) of all three images.

![Fig.1: Common extent of three images](fig/fig01.png)

X) Crop each of the image stacks
a) …to the common extent and create a multi-temporal stack of the three images. Please order them by acquisition day of year. 
b) …to the following ```custom_extent <- c(250000, 375000, 5589000, 5653000)```
  
------

### Writing data

X) Write the cropped stacks from Xa) and Xb) to your folder using ```writeRaster()```. Use the ```ENVI``` format and the appropriate ```datatype```. 

### Visualizing data

X)	Open the cropped images (Xb) in QGIS. Seek the symbology to create a true-color (red, green, blue) and a false-color representation (swIR1, nIR, red) of each image. Be aware that the order of the spectral regions in the electromagnetic spectrum (BGR) is different in your computer screen´s (RGB).

------

### Voluntary section

You managed to complete the assignment until this point? Great! In case you want to keep on going, try to complete the following voluntary tasks:

X)	Use the ```plotRGB()``` function in R to create a false-color visualization (e.g. swIR1, nIR, red) of each the image stacks you generated in Xb).

X)	Extract a spectral profile at coordinate x = 343225; y = 5605500. You can either use ```extract()``` or ```cellFromXY()``` to get the cell values using indexing.

X)	Visualize the results from X) in R. Can you create one plot that represents a total of three spectral profiles (one for each image in the stack) accounting for the band wavelength and acquisition date? See an example below…

## Reading materials

In the next session, we would like to discuss the following paper: 

[Zhu, Z., & Woodcock, C.E. (2012). Object-based cloud and cloud shadow detection in Landsat imagery. Remote Sensing of Environment, 118, 83–94.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2011.10.028)

This reading covers the basic aspects of the Fmask cloud and cloud shadow detection algorithm. It has been widely used for cloud detection on Landsat TM and ETM+ data. It was recently enhanced for the use with Landsat OLI and Sentinel 2 data (documented in [Zhu et al. 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2014.12.014)).

While reading try to find answers to the following questions:

- What is the general architecture of the algorithm?
- How were the thresholds for spectral tests derived?
- How will different types of error impact further analyses of the masked image?
